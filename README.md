## Skills and Knowledge Acquired

- 🕵️ **Recognized Poor Query Results**: Learned to identify when queries were producing poor results and how to address these issues effectively.

- 🤖 **Used a Large Language Model (LLM) to Enhance Queries**: Gained experience in utilizing a Large Language Model to improve the quality and accuracy of queries.

- 🔧 **Fine-Tuned Embeddings with User Feedback**: Developed skills in fine-tuning embeddings based on user feedback, enhancing the overall effectiveness and relevance of the search results.

## Key Learnings from the Course on Advanced Retrieval Techniques

### Overview
In this course, I delved into the concepts of Information Retrieval (IR) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). I learned that these techniques are only effective if the information retrieved from a database is relevant to the query and its application.

### Challenges Addressed
- I observed that queries often return semantically similar results but fail to answer the question posed, or they return irrelevant material, distracting the LLM from correct results.

### Advanced Retrieval Techniques Mastered

- 📈 **Query Expansion**: I learned to expand user queries to improve information retrieval by including related concepts and keywords. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) made this traditional technique even more effective. Additionally, I explored having the LLM suggest a possible answer to the query, which is then included in the expanded query.

- 🔍 **Cross-encoder Reranking**: I mastered reranking retrieval results to select the outcomes most relevant to the query, significantly improving the results.

- 🧠 **Training and Utilizing Embedding Adapters**: I developed the skill of adding an adapter layer to reshape embeddings, which improves retrieval by emphasizing elements relevant to specific applications.

This course equipped me with advanced techniques to enhance the relevancy of retrieval results, a crucial skill in the ever-evolving field of AI and machine learning.
